**This repo is not yet ready to be used although it is being actively developed and should result in some useful nuget packages once finished.**

AppleMusicAPI.NET is a .NET wrapper for [Apple Music Api](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi). The API provides clients with the ability to interact with Apple music resources and, provided you are able to generate a user token, modify a users library. User tokens can be generated in native Apple applications and also using [MusicKitJS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickitjs) which is currently in beta.
